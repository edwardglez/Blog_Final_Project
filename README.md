# Interesting Useful Blog

### Introduction
Interesting Useful Blog is a PERN stack application thay will allow you to blog about your wildest dreams!

### Motivation
During these past weeks I've felt like I wasn't good enough or I wasn't retaining any information from what we have learned.
I decided to create a blog for my final project. The motivation behind this blog is because I wanted to build a very simple app where I challenge myself to build a fullstack app on my own. I wanted my main focus on CRUD functionality as that's where I felt my confidence was lacking in.

## Future Developments
There are so many features that I'd like to implement in the future.
The main developments I want to add are the ability to add photos and comments within a post. 
At the moment the post are just cards and I would like to be able click on the card and open a show pag.
In my wireframes I do have a layout of how I'd like to set up those features.
# Restyling the app is also something I will be doing in the future.
